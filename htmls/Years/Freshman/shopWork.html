I used color schemes that I created on adobe color wheel. I used colors with the borders making it to be bars of color with some text in them. On the menu page I did the same thing with the backgrounds making bars but I had the name of the food in a separate bar. With the image of what the food is underneath it. 
          I learned how to style with color backgrounds to make different sections with color. I also learned about how to use and style images. I learned how to use definition lists. Along with learning on how to format my code and separate it to make it more readable and understandable.
