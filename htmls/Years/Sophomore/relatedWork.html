      <!--about assignment-->
      <div class="work_desc" id="openBtn"><h4>In this assignment, I connected a virtual smart power grid. In the assignment, it gives you a description of what happened during it, “In this smart grid example, the Smart Power Grid Switch was given processing capabilities to become able to run Javascript programs. Based on sensors and meters, it could then be aware of its environment and act upon a set of pre-defined conditions. The network devices and capabilities allow for the Smart Power Grid Switch to communicate over the network and join the IoT.” 

        I first labeled all of the routers in the workspace. Then I named a certain point and said its purpose. Answered question about what part does what. Then I gave the IP address of the Power IoT server. Gave the username and password being Username: Power password: power. 

        I thought It did a good job teaching. I learned a lot in the virtual field that was set for me. The problem set out for me was very challenging and it was fun to work in. I am glad I got to work on this assignment. It definitely was a fun challenge.

        In this activity  have observed the transfer of unencrypted FTP traffic between two geographic sites. Then I configured a VPN between two geographic sites and sent encrypted FTP traffic. I used client devices in different geographic locations to transfer FTP data unsecurely and securely.
        In the start of the lab we looked at what the cyber criminal would see within their sniffer tool. Then we looked at someone’s laptop to check their IP address along with connecting to the file backup server. Then we looked back at the sniffer that the cyber criminal had to see if anything was to appear from it. Next, we found the username and password in plaintext. 
        In the second half of the lab we check someone else’s IP address. And then we connected to their file backup server that took a few tries to connect. After signing into the file backup server we used the command of put to upload something to the server. Then we went back to the sniffer to look for anything, nothing was found.
        In this Lab I learned how VPNs affect how people are able to see your data such as login information using a sniffer.</p>
