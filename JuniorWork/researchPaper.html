MLDA, meaning minimum legal drinking age is what a country chooses to be the youngest age to consume alcohol. Every country has differing ages for the MLDA, but many all have a common age range for starting, 16-21. The different countries around the world having differing MLDAs might not sound like the biggest issue, but there definitely are some that come with it, and even more issues when people under the MLDA get their hands on it. Having differing legal drinking ages can cause issues such as traveling with alcohol and potentially lead to the arrest of the person who is carrying it, as it might not be legal for them to have in that country. Having a set legal drinking age will prevent that, as everywhere would have the same age requirements so if a person old enough to legally drink can not have it where they are traveling from they will know that they can not have it anywhere else either. That is just one small example of how having an overall static legal drinking age would benefit the world. </span><span class="c2">The world would be better if every country had the same legal drinking age, it would improve children&rsquo;s exposure to alcohol-causing abuse, alcohol will be seen less as a way to get away from things and more as something such as a social item and not for getting intoxicated, having a set age will have people that are responsible being the only people that are drinking.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Usually, children who are more exposed to alcohol have a high risk to drink under the MLDA. Around the world children experience how alcohol affects people, this could be from addiction or just walking past someone drunk. Experiences can be as small as seeing a commercial on television about any form of alcohol. As said by Heidi Splete, </span><span class="c2">&ldquo;Many factors that have an impact on alcohol use and abuse by children and teens are not specific to alcohol, the investigators noted. Instead, the development of both internalizing and externalizing behaviors can become either risk factors or protective factors with regard to a child&#39;s early experiences with alcohol.&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Children or teens under the MLDA, have parts about them as they grow up and develop, which can cause a much further use of alcohol and lead to abuse. These parts can develop from experiences that cause behaviors that make a child or teen grow closer to using alcohol. A child or teen who uses or abuses alcohol, will not always start with being given alcohol. It can start early in life before they have alcohol. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, there should be a universal minimum drinking age of 18. There should be a legal drinking age of 18 years old all across the world. Having it different in different countries can be harmful to groups of people who use alcohol in religion. As said on procon.org, </span><span class="c2">&ldquo;If you are old enough to fight for our country, if you&rsquo;re old enough to vote, if you&rsquo;re old enough to sign on thousands of dollars of student loans for a college education, then you are old enough to have a[n alcoholic] drink.&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If someone can vote for the next political leader, sign student loans which are very important things that require someone to be responsible to do. If a person is responsible to do these things they are responsible enough to drink. If an individual is 18 then said individual is responsible enough to drink.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, the universal MLDA could be higher at 21, for more safety worldwide. The older an individual is the more responsible they become, with more responsibility, fewer accidents, and lower chances of alcohol abuse. According to the CDC, </span><span class="c2">&ldquo;States that increased the legal drinking age to 21 saw a 16% median decline in motor vehicle crashes.&rdquo; </span><span class="c1">In Canada, where this research took place, they found that people even slightly younger than the MLDA of 19 might not be responsible enough, or just do not know how to be safe with drinking. Having the MLDA at a higher age could help stop abuse and death from alcohol.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, with no universal minimum legal drinking age, each country/state decides on the MLDA in their country/state. The world should keep its drinking laws the same, where every country or state gets to pick its own MLDA. Because each country has different cultures with how they drink, in some places like America many people drink to just get drunk. Meanwhile, in other countries, people will only drink a small amount during social gatherings. In a study by the Canadian Centre, about the effectiveness of the MLDA in Canada. &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">in comparing young adults slightly older than the MLDA with those slightly younger than the MLDA, Callaghan, Sanches, Gatley, and Cunningham (2013) found that those just older than the Ontario MLDA of 19 years demonstrated a jump in ER visits and hospital admissions for alcohol use disorders (10.8%), assaults (7.9%), and suicide (51.8%)&ldquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Each country needs to find the right age for their MLDA to fit their culture properly so everyone is safe and don&rsquo;t start abusing alcohol easily. Every country has a different MLDA that will not just benefit upcoming generations protecting them from drinking, but also keep countries&#39; cultures intact. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">At the same time, even if the one consuming alcohol is below the MLDA they need to be in a safe space. If people are drinking under the age of MLDA there is a high chance they are with friends at a party or alone. Which can be very dangerous. At a party, the other people do not get in trouble for underage drinking so they could ignore any medical issue that arises, the same with friends. But the real danger is drinking alone, there is a zero percent chance someone will be there to help them if they need help. Written by Halbert, Amy, </span><span class="c2">&ldquo;The Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act in 1984, establishing 21 as the minimum legal purchase age. Since then: Drinking by high school seniors has fallen substantially &mdash; from 66% to 42% (see chart). During this same period, binge drinking by high school seniors &mdash; that is, having five or more drinks on an occasion &mdash; has fallen from 37% to 24%.&rdquo; </span><span class="c1">Preventing minors from buying alcohol will lower the chance of any of the listed situations happening. This is a fantastic thing as many lives will be saved due to this. Drinking can be very dangerous but can be fine if the group or individual has the right people with them, that is, someone trustable.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these points, children, teens, and adults, all have to be responsible in the face of alcohol. At the end of things, age is not what makes someone mature enough to handle their actions while intoxicated. But, with most people responsibility comes with their age, meaning most people old enough to drink legally are responsible to handle it. 18 years old is a good age when people are starting to be responsible, not everyone will be ready at that age, but that is true with how it is everywhere. Another age that has people normally much more responsible is 21, 21 is the MLDA in America, and again as it always will be this way there will be people who are not responsible enough to drink. People should limit how much they drink when around children or will be going around children in the case of how it may affect the child later in their life. Children or teens that drink under the MLDA, while it is not good at all, still need to be safe and need someone else to be responsible for them in case of an emergency. Having no overall legal drinking age, keeping the world how it is currently will still have many issues that would be the same as before, people that are legal to drink but cannot handle the responsibility, along with possible confusion while traveling. There would be less needless confusion with the changing legal ages, and children would have a harder time getting access to alcohol, in many places in the world alcohol is just part of culture not a dependence on daily life, and worldwide people are more responsible when they are older.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Citations:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And Effectiveness of Minimum Legal in Canada - Ccsa.ca.&rdquo; Canadian Centre, 2017, </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c11"><a class="c12" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ccsa.ca/sites/default/files/2019-04/CCSA-Impact-Effectiveness-MLDA-Legislation-2017-en.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1712061319223742&amp;usg=AOvVaw33nOyQVCAzsLXKYkM1fLc1">https://ccsa.ca/sites/default/files/2019-04/CCSA-Impact-Effectiveness-MLDA-Legislation-2017-en.pdf</a></span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Minimum Legal Drinking Age of 21 Saves Lives.&rdquo; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 7 Dec. 2022, </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/minimum-legal-drinking-age.htm. </span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hebert, Amy, et al. &ldquo;21 Is the Legal Drinking Age.&rdquo; Consumer Advice, 13 Mar. 2018, </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0386-21-legal-drinking-age. </span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ProCon.org, &quot;Drinking Age.&quot; ProCon.org. 8 Sep. 2022, drinkingage.procon.org</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Splete, Heidi. &quot;Developmental factors play role in teen drinking: &#39;drinking problems of youths </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">have their beginnings well before alcohol use is initiated,&#39; researchers find.&quot; Internal </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Medicine News, vol. 41, no. 11, 1 June 2008, p. 16.
