The story of you and passing english class. Tommy, the indolent one has realized that the need to pass one of his classes, english due to his past of not doing well in it. Tommy&rsquo;s ability to do the work given to him was not good. And while doing &nbsp;remote learning it was like someone with short term memory loss was remembering something from their childhood. Knowing some and then stopping halfway through</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While doing the work for the class he exclaims &ldquo;I do not want do this work, but I must get it done soon.&rdquo; As he finishes this work, he realizes that his condition in the class is dire. The prerequisites to pass have been set high due to the lazy history for work completion in the class. Days later he comes to a conclusion that he has done poorly in the class because he is lazy and stressed by writing assignments. And with these thoughts the decision was born to work harder and focus on the class before others and put much more effort into the work that was needed, and needs to be completed. Deep within his mind three trials of sorts have formed thoughts: Telling his family about the grade situation, Reaching out to the teacher for help, and getting the work done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;The next day, Tommy, filled with tension, talked to his mother, &ldquo;Mother, I have realized that I am not doing well in a class. And I need your help to get the grade up and to not be stressed with assignments that require a bit of writing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I shall help you with whatever you need help with in this class, and you need to do your work and get that grade up soon. Also, about not getting stressed, just take the work one at a time and slowly but not slowly enough to never finish it.&rdquo; His mother replied. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you for understanding and being willing to help me in these difficult times.&rdquo; Tommy exclaimed thankfully. The next day at school, Tommy focused on the work and tried his hardest, not just in the class where the grade was low but all of them even finished some homework in class. The end of the day approaches and Tommy has the class where the need of work is located, he asks the teacher a simple question &ldquo;Excuse me but what can I do to get my grade up?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well Tommy, you need to start doing your work is a good start. And along with doing your work you need to make up some work as well.&rdquo; The helpful teacher cheerfully stated. &ldquo;Here I will make a list of assignments that you should complete that are missing.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Okay, thank you for being helpful in my situation. I will get the work done as soon as possible.&rdquo; Tommy stated almost petrified from the amount of work he will believe he will have to do. Later, he receives an email from the teacher that is a checklist. It&rsquo;s the list the teacher talked about before. As he looks at what he needs to do, he soon realizes that it is not a lot of work needed to be done, just time consuming work. With the new information of what needs to be done he gets to work and figures that it would be best to receive some assistance. So he goes to his mother, &ldquo;Excuse me mom, may you help me with the work that I need to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She replied quickly &ldquo;Sure, what do we need to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It is work where we need to look in a book, get page numbers and answers and examples of different things.&rdquo; Tommy lazily basically yawned. Hours passed by of the pair working and the work has been finished, both extremely glad that it has been done. Months pass, work has been good from Tommy and stress is not as much of a problem as it once has been. And soon with the pattern of doing what needs to and getting help quickly if it is needed with whatever is needed, he gets the grade high enough. And everything feels oh so good for him and his mother.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;In a new assignment that requires writing Tommy knows what to write but can&rsquo;t decide how to, like nothing&#39;s good enough. And soon feels this in most of the work that he has faced recently. A feeling of lackluster, not enough. But, the working is doing well other than how he feels. This feeling is weighing down upon the boy, a strong weight of stress to meet a standard set in the stars. The time spent doing work skyrockets. Most of the time at home is spent correcting, never meeting the above sky high standards that glare down on him from the heaven they rest in. The grade he has worked so hard for falls, drops down below the threshold that is needed. So the wish to lower them is made true when he spoke with the one who helped so much before, his mother. &ldquo;Mother, I once again am asking for help. I have set my work standards too high for me to reach every day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Okay, well then think about how you are doing in the class&rdquo; she quickly blurted, &ldquo;the work does not need to be the best work you have ever done, it just needs to be good not amazing, just enough.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tommy, indebted to his mother from all the advice and help bestowed upon him from his mother, takes this advice to heart. He quickly gets every assignment done, and done quite well. The fear of failing falls far far behind him and now he has the knowledge, never to be afraid to ask for help, especially for school work it is understandable to need help. Tommy ends the year with a passing grade in all classes. And feeling wonderful about his complete flip in a horrid grade to one may marvel at, just as he marvels at it himself.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
