In eighth grade, my goal was clear: to join Old Colony with my friends, hopefully in the same shop. However, most of them didn&#39;t enroll, leaving me to embark on this journey alone. Despite feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness, I saw it as a chance for a fresh start, eager to make new friends and delve into more advanced learning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Exploratory classes were meant to confirm my interest in computer science, but they led me down unexpected paths. From cosmetology to health careers, each module introduced me to different skills and subjects. While some, like electrical and electronics, caught my interest, others like CAD/CADD and graphic design didn&#39;t hold my attention. It wasn&#39;t until I found myself in the computer science realm that I felt truly at home, enjoying both the camaraderie and the challenging coursework.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Academically, transitioning from online classes back to full-time schooling posed its challenges. Initially intimidating due to unfamiliar faces, it soon became an opportunity for growth, both academically and socially. Despite struggling in certain subjects, particularly English, I persevered, driven by the desire to succeed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Returning to full-time school as a sophomore in the computer science shop brought its own hurdles. Adjusting from online to face-to-face learning demanded adaptation. However, the familiar environment of the shop and the support of my peers made the transition smoother, fostering a productive atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Reflecting on the past year, I&#39;ve realized the importance of self-discipline and effective communication. Online schooling offered flexibility but also led to complacency. Returning to the classroom highlighted the significance of diligence and interpersonal skills, essential for academic success and personal growth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The challenges I faced this year, from adjusting to new teachers and courses to honing problem-solving skills, have shaped my goals for the future. Moving forward, I aim to improve my ability to ask for help and collaborate with peers, recognizing the value of teamwork in reaching academic and personal milestones.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Despite the whirlwind of experiences and unexpected obstacles, I emerge from this year with a sense of accomplishment and excitement for the journey ahead. Each challenge has been a stepping stone toward growth and self-discovery. As I look to the future, I am ready to embrace whatever comes my way, armed with newfound resilience and determination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This year flew by compared to past school years. Facing new challenges such as a new math teacher, my first honors science class in chemistry, and a relocated teacher in Shop added to the mix. The new math teacher turned out to be kind and helpful, making learning enjoyable. Honors Chemistry was fun, except for missing a crucial lesson on chemical formulas. English was taught by a cool teacher, and history remained consistent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This year overall was challenging, with a heavier workload and stricter deadlines. The first trimester overwhelmed with information and immediate homework. A new homework policy eased stress but caused concerns among parents. In Shop, learning Java presented initial difficulty but grew enjoyable over time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Senior year begins, everything feels more relaxed. Teachers&#39; demeanor creates an easygoing atmosphere, facilitating better connections and learning. Despite struggles in AP PreCalc, adjustments led to improvements across all classes. Catching up on work and feeling happier in school, I realize I&#39;ll miss this place after graduation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
