          The map app is a map that has landmarks. You can add or remove landmarks using a button that brings up a menu with the options. It also has the Wikipedia page of what the landmark is if you have put it in correctly and named it correctly. The attached file about this assignment contains information about the purpose, function, and how it is made.

            In one app I created a game where you click on a picture of a cookie and buy upgrades with a function to update the price of the upgrades. It took a while to add the shop feature due to issues with having blocks set to the wrong object. The attached file about this assignment contains information about the purpose, function, and how it is made.
