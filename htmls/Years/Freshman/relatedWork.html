Then I configured a VPN between two geographic sites and sent encrypted FTP traffic. I used client devices in different geographic locations to transfer FTP data unsecurely and securely.
      In the start of the lab we looked at what the cyber criminal would see within their sniffer tool. Then we looked at someone’s laptop to check their IP address along with connecting to the file backup server. Then we looked back at the sniffer that the cyber criminal had to see if anything was to appear from it. Next, we found the username and password in plaintext. 
      In the second half of the lab we check someone else’s IP address. And then we connected to their file backup server that took a few tries to connect. After signing into the file backup server we used the command of put to upload something to the server. Then we went back to the sniffer to look for anything, nothing was found.
      In this Lab I learned how VPNs affect how people are able to see your data such as login information using a sniffer.
