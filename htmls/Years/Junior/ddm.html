        <div class="work_desc" id="openBtn"><h4>My Crossword program is a prgram that reads from a file and uses information from that file to generate a crossword puzzle. It takes in information such as, the clue for the word, what the word is, what direction the word is going (horizontal or vertical), and where the first letter of the word should be. It works with any amount of possible words that give the proper information in the file.
          The Crossword program was made in the Java programming language, using many complex components such as two dimensional arrays. This program is built around objects and said two dimensional arrays. The main part of this program is based on comparing chars, character variables to see if each letter is the correct letter for each cell of the crossword puzzle.
          The main methods of this program are: DisplayAllClues, DIsplaySpecificClue, EraseAnswer, MakeAGuess, SubmitAnswer, and Exit. Most of these methods explain what they do quite well just by the name of the method, which makes the code easier to understand and read. Easy to read and understand code makes working with other programmers and work on longer projects easier, along with proper commenting.</h4></div>
