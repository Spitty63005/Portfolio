        <h2>How can astronauts maintain their muscle mass during a trip to Mars?</h2>

        <h2>Loss of bone and muscle mass are the two most common and troublesome changes that occur in the bodies of humans after a significant time in space.</h2>
        <h2>Once they reach Mars, they would be too weak to do anything.</h2>
