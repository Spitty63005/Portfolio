        <h1>The Solution: </h1>
        <h2>The current exercise that astronauts do wouldn't be enough to sustain their muscle mass.<br><br> We decided that if the astronauts slept in a centrifuge emulating the gravity on Earth then their muscles would stay strong enough for them to work on Mars.</h2>

      <h2>Exercise</h2>
      <p class = "solutionText">Currently, astronauts use stationary bikes, treadmills, and weightlifting machines to try and stay active in space. Even with these, over an extended space journey, their muscles and bone density would deteriorate to the point where they would no longer be able to walk, even on Mars where the gravity is weaker than Earth’s.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Velocity</h2>
      <p class = "solutionText">The outer velocity of the ship can be that of a normal spaceship, although it should be fast enough to reach Mars within the 9-month timeframe. The ship will feature a centralized centrifugal room where they can sleep. The room can spin at 9.81 m/s2, creating the feeling of normal gravity. </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Exercise On Mars</h2>
      <p class = "solutionText">There is gravity on Mars, so the astronauts wouldn’t need to work as hard as they did in microgravity to maintain their bodies. They could even use the normal exercise equipment that we use on Earth, or they could just stick with what astronauts are currently using.</p>
</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <p class = "solutionText">Instead of worrying about having to work out, the astronauts can simply sleep in the room which should be enough to maintain muscle mass. They would still have to exercise, but maybe for 3 quarters of the time that they did before.</p>
